Considering how rapidly buildings are built and torn down in China, I can imagine that next time I will go, I will experience a completely different city. In the time I was there I loved everything about it, aside from the bad pollution. Locals are extremely welcoming, sceneries and historical cities are breathtaking and the food...the best I have ever had (sorry, Grandma)",

For people under 25 (as I was back then) all museums are free. Imagine getting a few beers with your colleagues after work and casually walk in the Louvre at 10pm, free of charge...pure bliss. However, rent is soooo expensive. ",

Although all my friends from school have left the city it is still such a warm feeling going back to this beautiful town. It might not be as pretty as Florence, but there are a few spots in the city that are really breath-taking! If you go there don't forget to try the pizza at Pizzeria da Montino. Speck and Mascarpone it's their specialty, for vegans and vegetarians a nice slice of Cecina (local chickpea pie). You won't regret it!",

However the city is fun for students, with a lot of opportunities to socialize and party. Some parts of the city are a bit risky at night, but most neighbourhoods are safe. It's absolutely normal to see all seasons over one day. On a sunny day it can rain and hail and snow within a few hours from each other.",
